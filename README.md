# <div align="center"> InvestSky StockApp</div>

<p align="center">A Responsive React Native Application of an Stock app where the user has access toa list of stocks, and get some information about them.</p>

# Getting Started

## Step 1: ðŸš€ Installation

`````
$ git clone https://github.com/MatheusDevios/StockApp.git
$ cd InvestSkyStockApp
$ npm install


## Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

````bash
# using npm
npm start

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
