# Getting Started

## Step 1: ðŸš€ Installation

$ git clone https://github.com/MatheusDevios/StockApp.git
$ cd InvestSkyStockApp
$ npm install

You might also need to install pod dependencies into the cd ios.

$ cd ios
$ pod install

## Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

````bash
# using npm
npm start

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:


You can follow the metro instructions or follow the below steps.

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly.


This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode, respectively.
